This covers upgrading from any version prior to 7.x-2.1beta1

7.x-2.1beta1 is a complete refactoring of the code of this module.  Many 
functions where renamed and many files were renamed in order to adhere to
Drupal.org coding standards.  This renaming could or could not affect your
existing rules.  Therefore, in order to upgrade your module you
will have to do a couple of steps.  This is the safest route for upgrading.

1. Disable all Rules that are built on this module.
2. Export all Rules you may have built on this module.
3. Delete all Rules that are built on this module.
4. Delete the existing module files and folder.
5. Reinstall CRE with the latest code.
6. Restore Rules from your exports in #2

You may choose to not disable, export, delete, and restore your rules but you
must complete #4 and #5 or you will cause Drupal to crash - the old module files
must be deleted.
