= PDF To Image =

The PDF To Image module provides automatic conversion of
uploaded PDF files to images.
It can be used either to create a snapshot of the front page,
or to generate a gallery of images from each page in the document.

The module provides a new widget for managing PDF file uploads.
It places generated images into a nominated Image field on the same content 
type.

== Requirements ==

  * File field, Image field and (optionally) Imagemagick module.
  
  * ImageMagick toolkit to be available on server via command-line interface.
    http://drupal.org/project/imagemagick

If the Drupal imagemagick.module is not available, the process will still run, 
however imagemagick is recommended for win32 installations and it has better
diagnostics available.

== Installation ==

You must have the imagemagick tools available on your server, and able to
be called from the commandline.
Running 
  which convert
on your server should tell you if and where the binary exists.

Once the module is enabled, check your site status at /admin/reports/status
You should see a message that will tell you if your system is ready to run.
"Imagemagick support for PDF to Image"
If not, you need to check the requirements, and the ImageMagick settings
at admin/config/media/image-toolkit.
See the ImageMagick project docs for troubleshooting that.

If ImageMagick appears to be available but still does not convert PDFs, it
could be it wasn't installed with 'Ghostscript' libraries or other required
dependencies. You'l have to go to the ImageMagick forums for help with that.

== Configuration ==

=== Quickstart ===

A 'feature' has been provided that will ato-configure a demonstration content 
type with some default settings applied.

- Download and enabled 'features' module.
- Enable 'PDF document'

You should now be able to "Add content Â» Document" and try out the function.
To work this into your own site structure, see below.

=== Manual configuration ===

- First, add an image field on your chosen content type. This is where the
  generated images will be stored.
- Set the allowed fields to 1 if you just want a cover page, direct number to
  store only some count of pages or 'unlimited' if you want all pages
  to be generated.
- Next add a filefield to your chosen content type and choose
  'PDF to Image' as the widget.
  This filefield should be configured to only accept PDF file types.
- When configuring this field, you will be required to link the uploaded file
  field with the target image field.
- You can add image style handling to the image field rendering as normal to
  adjust the size of the results and how they display on the page.

== Processing ==

Processing of PDF may take some time.

Larger documents use the 'batch' process to generate each page.

== Use of ImageMagick ==

Actual processing is perfomed using ImageAPI's ImageMagick toolkit.
GD is not supported.

== Field paths and tokens ==

This module SHOULD be compatable with http://drupal.org/project/filefield_paths
which allows you to customize the file folders and file names of the uploaded
and generated images. A custom token
  [node:p2i-source-filename] 
is available to allow you to name the derived images after the source PDF 
if you wish.

=== Dev notes ===

The only candidate function from ImageAPI which may perform PDF to image
convertion is _imageapi_imagemagick_convert(). Unfortunately, it can't pass
arguments to 'convert' tool of ImageMagick *before* source file specification,
which is needed to change default density of 100x100dpi.
On this reason, a custom functionis included in the module's source:

function pdf_to_image_generate_page($params, $page_number = 0) {
  . . .
}
